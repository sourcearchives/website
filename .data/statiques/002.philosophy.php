  900$ number is not a magic number : I made the math starting with the  
minimal french salary, and added the tax I pay to be an independent  
artist.<br />Under 900$, I must keep doing freelance works ( slow Pepper&amp;Carrot production, less than 1 episode per month ).<br />Over 900$, I can draw fulltime Pepper&amp;Carrot ( fast Pepper&amp;Carrot production, 2 episodes per month ).<br /><br /><br /><big><a href="https://www.patreon.com/davidrevoy" title="For only 1$ per new episode, become a patreon of Pepper&amp;Carrot">help me to boost Pepper&amp;Carrot production today</a><br /><br /><br /><br /></big><em><img src="data/images/static/2015-02-09_philosophy_02-money-meter.jpg" alt="" /><br /><br /></em></div><br /><br /><div align="right">Thank you for reading !<br />-David Revoy<br /><br /><br /><br /></div></div>
