Welcome,

/!\ This wiki is a sample of the real one. Do not edit it here. It has it's own repository

This wiki contains information to learn about **Hereva**, the open-world of Pepper&Carrot and exists to help the Pepper&Carrot community to create [derivations](https://www.peppercarrot.com/categorie4/derivations), such as: comics, movies, video-games, fan-fiction, etc...

## Rules

**Edit**: Everyone can edit and correct the pages. An easy edit button is on the right sidebar.

**Update**: The pages published here are synced manually. Your edit won't appear online immediately.

**Content**: Only themes about Pepper&Carrot can be written on the Wiki. Other content will be deleted.

**Creative input**: You can extend the universe of Hereva by [sending me](mailto:info@davidrevoy.com) your work as a [derivation](https://www.peppercarrot.com/categorie4/derivations) or a [fan-fiction](https://www.peppercarrot.com/en/categorie9/fan-fiction) (developing your own characters, places, creatures.). Interesting ideas will be reinjected back into the Wiki.
