TODO for the website
====================

Here is a list of task I'll can't do, but I'll welcome any help about it:

## Wiki: Add a "next page" button

Modify /themes/peppercarrot-theme_v2/lib-wiki.php to add a button
on the bottom of the page to read the next page. You'll need to
create an array from the creation of the menu, then locate the
actual page and retrieve the page+1 link in the array.

It can be only a link and I'll decorate it later with the CSS and 
responsive system.
