List of ideal TODO for the website
==================================

Feel free to pick an item and helps ;-)

## Author page

Improves CONTRIBUTORS.md in the repository peppercarrot/webcomics.

- Add mini photos/avatar and contact (email/website) of our contributors (needs contact, permission
- Refactor the list of lang with header title and developp a little more "who does what". Old README are still visible [here](https://framagit.org/peppercarrot/webcomics/commit/14947ec1f2c1e53247b49a4e85c449488bf12fd5). (eg. userX lead is actual translation, userY translated ep01/02, userZ corrected episode 6).
- Remove "My carreer in 7 bubbles:" and integrate the "About David Revoy" better to the CONTRIBUTORS.md.

## Sources/Translation Status

- Split the big php table of "ISO => longisoname" in static-sources.php: we need an external peppercarrotISO.json maybe to manage that.


## Commentaires

- La façon de gérer les customs avatars dans commentaires.php l.30 est primitive.
